## Struggle to come up with a good idea for the first video

## Priority: Interesting topic and meaningful for anyone

## Computers - used every day but I personally don't know that much about them, for example:

- When was the first computer invented, and by who?
- What did the first computer look like?
- How did the evolution of computers progress over time?
- Who had major impacts on further development of the computers as we know them today
- Has the purpose / job of a computer changed over time, and in that case how?

## What is a computer today and how do they work?

### A simple definition

#### Abacus / Counting frame

- Mechanical device used to assist a person perform a mathaematical calculation and counting
- Used before written numbers even existed
- Merchants would draw lines in the sand and place pebbles between those lines as placeholders representing numbers. The spaces between the lines would represent the units 10s, 100s, etc.
- Wealthier merchaints had small wooden tables with raised borders filled with sand. More portable, could be picked up and moved elsewhere
- Abacus still widely used in Asian schools and a few in the West. Blind kids are taught how to caculate using these while the rest are taught with pen and paper to perform calculations.
- Still used today by shopkeepers in Asia and "Chinatowns" in North America
- Most advanced calculation tool of its time
- Before the invention of computers, calculators, and before arithmetic use of pen and paper
- Before the abacus people would use counting fingers, toes and stones in the dirt as counting tools
- Unknown who invented the abacus and when
