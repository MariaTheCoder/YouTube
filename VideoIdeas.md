## Computers - used every day but I personally don't know that much about them, for example:

- When was the first computer invented, and by who?
- What did the first computer look like?
- How did the evolution of computers progress over time?
- Who had major impacts on further development of the computers as we know them today
- Has the purpose / job of a computer changed over time, and in that case how?
